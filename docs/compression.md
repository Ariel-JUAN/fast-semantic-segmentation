# Network Compression For ICNet

A vital component too achieve real-time performance with ICNet is network compression. In particular, ICNet relies on a process called Filter Pruning which can be generally described as simply removing covolutional kernels from the model. The amount of filters removed can be specified with a compression factor that ranges from 0 to 1 which correspond to the percentage of filters removed from each Conv layer in the network.
